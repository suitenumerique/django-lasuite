# Using malware detection backend

If you are developing a service where users can upload files, you will probably want to check if these files are safe or not.

The malware detection app is here to give you several backend implementations and others can be added to match your requirements.

## Global idea

A backend should inherit from `lasuite.malware_detection.backends.base.BaseBackend` class and implement the abstract methods declared in it.
The backend service then is responsible to analyse the file and give an answer by calling a defined callback.

### Abstract methods

- `def analyse_file(self, file_path: str, **kwargs) -> None:`: it is the entrypoint to analyse a file. This method returns nothing and can analyse the file by using a celery task. The parameters to use:
    - `file_path`: the path to access the file. This path must be accessible with the django default storage.
    - `kwargs`: arbitrary kwargs usable by the user using the library. These kwargs will be used by the callback. You can for example pass a resource id or whatever useful for you.

### How to use a backend

We provide a handler responsible to instantiate and configure a backend. You have to declare in your settings the backend to use with their needed parameters.

The settings to use is `settings.MALWARE_DETECTION`. It is a `dict` containing two keys: `BACKEND` and `PARAMETERS`. The `BACKEND` is the full path to the backend class and the `PARAMETERS` is a dict containing all the parameters needed to instantiate the backend class.

Example:

```python
settings.MALWARE_DETECTION = {
    "BACKEND": "lasuite.malware_detection.backends.dummy.DummyBackend",
    "PARAMETERS": {
        "callback_path": "path.to.your.callback",
    },
}
```

Every backend has at least the `callback_path` parameter. The callback is explained just before.

Then to use the backend in your code, you have to import the `lasuite.malware_detection.malware_detection` and call the `analyse_file` method.

Example:

```python
from lasuite.malware_detection import malware_detection

malware_detection.analyse_file("path/to/your/file.txt")
```


### Callback

In order to know the detection status, as it can be asynchronous, you have to create your own callback. This callback is a function that will be called once the analysis is done.

This function receives these parameters:
    - `file_path` the `file_path` used in the `analyse_file` method
    - `status` the analysis status (see `lasuite.malware_detection.enums.ReportStatus`). It can be `safe`, `unsafe` and `unknown`. In case of `unknown` you are responsible to determine what you should do
    - `error_info` a dict containing `error` and `error_code` properties.
    - `kwargs` the kwargs you pass to the `analyse_file` method

## Existing implementations

### Dummy

path: `lasuite.malware_detection.backends.dummy.DummyBackend`
parameters:
    - `callback_path`: the full path to the callback.

The `dummy` backend does nothing. It calls the `callback` with always the `safe` status. It can be useful in a test context or to deactivate analysis.

Example:

```python
settings.MALWARE_DETECTION = {
    "BACKEND": "lasuite.malware_detection.backends.dummy.DummyBackend",
    "PARAMETERS": {
        "callback_path": "path.to.your.callback",
    },
}
```

### JCOP

`JCOP` means for [Je Clique Ou Pas](https://jecliqueoupas.cyber.gouv.fr/accueil). To use it you need the url and the api token provided by them.

path: `lasuite.malware_detection.backends.jcop.JCOPBackend`
parameters:
- `api_key`: The API key provided by JCOP
- `base_url`: The base URL provided by JCOP (including the `/api/v1` base path)
- `callback_path`: the full path to the callback.
- `result_timeout`: The timeout for the result request. Default: 30 (optional)
- `submit_timeout`: The timeout for the submit request. Default: 600 (optional)

Example:

```python
settings.MALWARE_DETECTION = {
    "BACKEND": "lasuite.malware_detection.backends.jcop.JCOPBackend",
    "PARAMETERS": {
        "callback_path": "path.to.your.callback",
        "api_key": "xxx",
        "base_url": "https://malware_detection.tld/api/v1"
    },
}
```
